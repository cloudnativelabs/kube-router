## Try Kube-router with cluster installers

The best way to get started is to deploy Kubernetes with Kube-router is with a cluster installer.

### kops
Please see the [steps](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/master/docs/kops.md) to deploy Kubernetes cluster with Kube-router using [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)

### bootkube
Please see the [steps](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/tree/master/contrib/bootkube) to deploy Kubernetes cluster with Kube-router using [bootkube](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/bootkube)

### kubeadm
Please see the [steps](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/master/docs/kubeadm.md) to deploy Kubernetes cluster with Kube-router using [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/create-cluster-kubeadm/)

### generic
Please see the [steps](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/blob/master/docs/generic.md) to deploy kube-router on manually installed clusters

### Amazon specific notes
When running in an AWS environment that requires an explicit proxy you need to inject the proxy server as a [environment variable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/) in your kube-router deployment

Example:

    env:
    - name: HTTP_PROXY
      value: "http://proxy.example.com:80"


## deployment

Depending on what functionality of kube-router you want to use, multiple deployment options are possible. You can use the flags `--run-firewall`, `--run-router`, `--run-service-proxy` to selectively enable only required functionality of kube-router.

Also you can choose to run kube-router as agent running on each cluster node. Alternativley you can run kube-router as pod on each node through daemonset.

## requirements

- Kube-router need to access kubernetes API server to get information on pods, services, endpoints, network policies etc. The very minimum information it requires is the details on where to access the kubernetes API server. This information can be passed as `kube-router --master=http://192.168.1.99:8080/` or `kube-router --kubeconfig=<path to kubeconfig file>`.

- If you run kube-router as agent on the node, ipset package must be installed on each of the nodes (when run as daemonset, container image is prepackaged with ipset)

- If you choose to use kube-router for pod-to-pod network connectivity then Kubernetes controller manager need to be configured to allocate pod CIDRs by passing `--allocate-node-cidrs=true` flag and providing a `cluster-cidr` (i.e. by passing --cluster-cidr=10.1.0.0/16 for e.g.)

- If you choose to run kube-router as daemonset, then both kube-apiserver and kubelet must be run with `--allow-privileged=true` option

- If you choose to use kube-router for pod-to-pod network connecitvity then Kubernetes cluster must be configured to use CNI network plugins. On each node CNI conf file is expected to be present as /etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conf .`bridge` CNI plugin and `host-local` for IPAM should be used. A sample conf file that can be downloaded as `wget -O /etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/cni/10-kuberouter.conf`

## running as daemonset

This is quickest way to deploy kube-router (**dont forget to ensure the requirements**). Just run

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/daemonset/kube-router-all-service-daemonset.yaml
```

Above will run kube-router as pod on each node automatically. You can change the arguments in the daemonset definition as required to suit your needs. Some samples can be found at https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/tree/master/daemonset with different argument to select set of the services kube-router should run.

## running as agent

You can choose to run kube-router as agent runnng on each node. For e.g if you just want kube-router to provide ingress firewall for the pods then you can start kube-router as
```
kube-router --master=http://192.168.1.99:8080/ --run-firewall=true --run-service-proxy=false --run-router=false
```

## cleanup configuration

Please delete kube-router daemonset and then clean up all the configurations done (to ipvs, iptables, ipset, ip routes etc) by kube-router on the node by running below command.

```
docker run --privileged --net=host cloudnativelabs/kube-router --cleanup-config
```

## trying kube-router as alternative to kube-proxy

If you have a kube-proxy in use, and want to try kube-router just for service proxy you can do
```
kube-proxy --cleanup-iptables
```
followed by
```
kube-router --master=http://192.168.1.99:8080/ --run-service-proxy=true --run-firewall=false --run-router=false
```
and if you want to move back to kube-proxy then clean up config done by kube-router by running
```
 kube-router --cleanup-config
```
and run kube-proxy with the configuration you have.

## Advertising IPs

kube-router can advertise Cluster, External and LoadBalancer IPs to BGP peers.
It does this by:
* locally adding the advertised IPs to the nodes' `kube-dummy-if` network interface
* advertising the IPs to its BGP peers

To set the default for all services use the `--advertise-cluster-ip`,
`--advertise-external-ip` and `--advertise-loadbalancer-ip` flags.

To selectively enable or disable this feature per-service use the
`kube-router.io/service.advertise.clusterip`, `kube-router.io/service.advertise.externalip`
and `kube-router.io/service.advertise.loadbalancerip` annotations.

e.g.:
`$ kubectl annotate service my-advertised-service "kube-router.io/service.advertise.clusterip=true"`
`$ kubectl annotate service my-advertised-service "kube-router.io/service.advertise.externalip=true"`
`$ kubectl annotate service my-advertised-service "kube-router.io/service.advertise.loadbalancerip=true"`

`$ kubectl annotate service my-non-advertised-service "kube-router.io/service.advertise.clusterip=false"`
`$ kubectl annotate service my-non-advertised-service "kube-router.io/service.advertise.externalip=false"`
`$ kubectl annotate service my-non-advertised-service "kube-router.io/service.advertise.loadbalancerip=false"`

By combining the flags with the per-service annotations you can choose either
a opt-in or opt-out strategy for advertising IPs.

Advertising LoadBalancer IPs works by inspecting the services
`status.loadBalancer.ingress` IPs that are set by external LoadBalancers like
for example MetalLb. This has been successfully tested together with
[MetalLB](https://github.com/google/metallb) in ARP mode.


## Hairpin Mode

Communication from a Pod that is behind a Service to its own ClusterIP:Port is
not supported by default.  However, It can be enabled per-service by adding the
`kube-router.io/service.hairpin=` annotation, or for all Services in a cluster by
passing the flag `--hairpin-mode=true` to kube-router.

Additionally, the `hairpin_mode` sysctl option must be set to `1` for all veth
interfaces on each node.  This can be done by adding the `"hairpinMode": true`
option to your CNI configuration and rebooting all cluster nodes if they are
already running kubernetes.

Hairpin traffic will be seen by the pod it originated from as coming from the
Service ClusterIP if it is logging the source IP.

### Hairpin Mode Example

10-kuberouter.conf
```json
{
    "name":"mynet",
    "type":"bridge",
    "bridge":"kube-bridge",
    "isDefaultGateway":true,
    "hairpinMode":true,
    "ipam": {
        "type":"host-local"
     }
}
```

To enable hairpin traffic for Service `my-service`:
```
kubectl annotate service my-service "kube-router.io/service.hairpin="
```

## Direct server return

Please read below blog on how to user DSR in combination with `--advertise-external-ip` to build highly scalable and available ingress.
https://cloudnativelabs.github.io/post/2017-11-01-kube-high-available-ingress/

You can enable DSR(Direct Server Return) functionality per service. When enabled service endpoint
will directly respond to the client by passing the service proxy. When DSR is enabled Kube-router 
will uses LVS's tunneling mode to achieve this.

To enable DSR you need to annotate service with `kube-router.io/service.dsr=tunnel` annotation. For e.g.

```
kubectl annotate service my-service "kube-router.io/service.dsr=tunnel"
```

**In the current implementation when annotation is applied on the service, DSR will be applicable only to the external IP's.**

**Also when DSR is used, current implementation does not support port remapping. So you need to use same port and target port for the service**

You will need to enable `hostIPC: true` and `hostPID: true` in kube-router daemonset manifest.
Also host path `/var/run/docker.sock` must be made a volumemount to kube-router.

Above changes are required for kube-router to enter pod namespeace and create ipip tunnel in the pod and to 
assign the external IP to the VIP. 

For an e.g manifest please look at [manifest](../daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter-all-features-dsr.yaml) with DSR requirements enabled.

## Load balancing Scheduling Algorithms

Kube-router uses LVS for service proxy. LVS support rich set of [scheduling alogirthms](http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/IPVS#Job_Scheduling_Algorithms). You can annotate 
the service to choose one of the scheduling alogirthms. When a service is not annotated `round-robin` scheduler is selected by default

```
For least connection scheduling use:
kubectl annotate service my-service "kube-router.io/service.scheduler=lc"

For round-robin scheduling use:
kubectl annotate service my-service "kube-router.io/service.scheduler=rr"

For source hashing scheduling use:
kubectl annotate service my-service "kube-router.io/service.scheduler=sh"

For destination hashing scheduling use:
kubectl annotate service my-service "kube-router.io/service.scheduler=dh"
```

## HostPort support

If you would like to use `HostPort` functionality below changes are required in the manifest.

- By default kube-router assumes CNI conf file to be `/etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conf`. Add an environment variable `KUBE_ROUTER_CNI_CONF_FILE` to kube-router manifest and set it to `/etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conflist`
- Modify `kube-router-cfg` ConfigMap with CNI config that supports `portmap` as additional plug-in
```
    {
       "cniVersion":"0.3.0",
       "name":"mynet",
       "plugins":[
          {
             "name":"kubernetes",
             "type":"bridge",
             "bridge":"kube-bridge",
             "isDefaultGateway":true,
             "ipam":{
                "type":"host-local"
             }
          },
          {
             "type":"portmap",
             "capabilities":{
                "snat":true,
                "portMappings":true
             }
          }
       ]
    }
```
- Update init container command to create `/etc/cni/net.d/10-kuberouter.conflist` file
- Restart the container runtime

For an e.g manifest please look at [manifest](../daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter-all-features-hostport.yaml) with necessary changes required for `HostPort` functionality.

## IPVS Graceful termination support

As of 0.2.6 we support experimental graceful termination of IPVS destinations. When possible the pods's TerminationGracePeriodSeconds is used, if it cannot be retrived for some reason
the fallback period is 30 seconds and can be adjusted with `--ipvs-graceful-period` cli-opt

graceful termination works in such a way that when kube-router receives a delete endpoint notification for a service it's weight is adjusted to 0 before getting deleted after he termination grace period has passed or the Active & Inactive connections goes down to 0.
