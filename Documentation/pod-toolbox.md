# Pod Toolbox

When kube-router is ran as a Pod within your Kubernetes cluster, it also ships
with a number of tools automatically configured for your cluster.  These can be
used to troubleshoot issues and learn more about how cluster networking is
performed.

## Logging In

Here's a quick way to get going on a random node in your cluster:
```
KR_POD="basename $(kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=kube-router --output name|head -n1)"
kubectl -n kube-system exec -it ${KR_POD} bash
```

Use `kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l k8s-app=kube-router -o wide` to see what
nodes are running which pods. This will help if you want to investigate a
particular node.

## Tools And Usage

Once logged in you will see some help on using the tools in the container.

For example:
```console
Welcome to kube-router on "node1.zbrbdl"!

For debugging, the following tools are available:
- ipvsadm | Gather info about Virtual Services and Real Servers via IPVS.
          | Examples:
          |   ## Show all options
          |   ipvsadm --help
          |   ## List Services and Endpoints handled by IPVS
          |   ipvsadm -ln
          |   ## Show traffic rate information
          |   ipvsadm -ln --rate
          |   ## Show cumulative traffic
          |   ipvsadm -ln --stats

- gobgp   | Get BGP related information from your nodes.
          |
          | Tab-completion is ready to use, just type "gobgp <TAB>"
          | to see the subcommands available.
          |
          | By default gobgp will query the Node this Pod is running
          | on, i.e. "node1.zbrbdl". To query a different node use
          | "gobgp --host node02.mydomain" as an example.
          |
