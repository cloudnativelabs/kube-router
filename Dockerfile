# Basically even under QEMU emulation, it still doesn't have an ARM kernel in-play which means that calls to
# iptables-nft will fail in the build process. The sanity check here only makes sure that iptables-nft and iptables-legacy
# are installed and that we are not using iptables-1.8.0-1.8.3. For now we'll manage that on our own.
